mathematical statistics (course 2, math stat. )

matstat.txt - example of selection
main.py consists 3 four classes

To read your selection run read_file method in MatStat class (you can change filename)


How to get solution of task?
In main method create an object of task class and run method print_(number of you task)_task()

Do not forget read data from file.
